# socialhack-front

React native app created for the #SocialHack hackathon.

Live demo available [here](http://socialhack-frontend.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/)

**Warning:** Backend is no longer accessible

No backend is connected.

It uses:
 - React navigation API (drawer and stack)
 - Context API 
  - Handles user information (login status, id token, user attributes)
  - Handles content (makes API calls to the backend whenever is needed to display the user required)
 - Axios to handle API calls

I am very proud to have developed the frontend part of this project in around 20h.
